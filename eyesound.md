<h2><strong>Participate in the EyeSound experiment!</strong></h2>

Do you want to learn how to make sounds with your eyes?  Come to our lab in the Campus Mundet of the University of Barcelona and participate in my EEG study. 
We pay 5â‚¬ per 30 minutes, and the experiment lasts 3.5 to 4 hours. You have to perform a memory game while EEG is recorded from your head. 
It is important not to need glasses or contact lenses, not to be taking any psychoactive drugs, have hearing problems or a neurological condition, and you have to have a Spanish bank account in your name.
