        Hello! My name is Stefanie, I am currently working as a predoctoral researcher at the Brainlab â€“ Cognitive Neuroscience Research Group at the University of Barcelona, and I have put together this page here as a sort of online portfolio. Working in neuroscience, I have learned a lot about data science, and I decided to make some projects for fun and/or to learn how to translate my skills into other areas. Yes, I will be looking for a job very soon! Get in touch!
