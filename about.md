I'm a PhD student at the University of Barcelona interested in the evolution of human cognition. I am part of the <a href="http://cbl.ub.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cognitive Biology of Language Group</a>, where I work under the supervision of <a href="https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/cedric-boeckx--493" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cedric Boeckx</a>. I work on topics related to the molecular basis of cognitive processes and intellectual disability. I am currently interested in the role of the cerebellum in the evolution of language-related cognitive functions, and I specifically focus on Down syndrome as a possible window into understanding human evolution. I also like to write and draw cartoons. This is my online CV.
