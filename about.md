I'm a PhD student of psychology at the University of Barcelona. I am interested in cognitive science broadly, and more specifically in the interactions between action planning, perception, and thought. I am currently working on topics related to motor-auditory interactions and the role of the cerebellum in cognitive processes. I have a B.A. in linguistics, an M.A. in cognitive science and an M.Sc. in cognitive neuroscience. I also like to write about science and other things, and draw cartoons. This is my online CV.
