I'm a PhD student at the University of Barcelona interested in human cognition â€“ how does it work? What makes it special? What variation is possible, and what happens when that variation goes too far? I am currently working on topics related to the role of the cerebellum in cognitive processes. I have a B.A. in linguistics, an M.A. in cognitive science and an M.Sc. in cognitive neuroscience. I also like to write about science and other things, and draw cartoons. This is my online CV.
